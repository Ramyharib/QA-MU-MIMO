# QA-MU-MIMO
MU-MIMO optimization using Quantum Annealing.   
User demand for increasing quantities of wireless capacity continues to exceed availability,
 hence great development has been made in new MIMO wireless physical layer approaches to
 accommodate this demand. Higher-performance systems are now mostly impracticable due
 to their incredibly computationally demanding algorithms.
 In this project, a Maximum likelihood (ML) detection method for Multi-User MIMO was
 implemented on a Quantum Annealing device for a Centralized Radio Access Network
 (C-RAN). The proposed design finds the optimal solution by exploring all possible solutions
 in search space simultaneously, and hence reducing the computation complexity of the
 conventional ML decoder.
 Simulation results show that the proposed system is capable of achieving an extremely
 low Bit Error Rate BER for a large number of users and base station antennas, requiring
 only order of Âµ seconds of computation time, while being unfeasible to solve by classical
 computer.
